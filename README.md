# Schedule

This is my schedule for courses at Cornell University, using the CodyHouse schedule template.

## Dependencies

This experiment is built upon the [CodyHouse Framework](https://github.com/CodyHouse/codyhouse-framework).

Make sure to include both the style.scss and util.js files of the framework.
